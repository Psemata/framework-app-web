## Answer to a quizz given by our teacher
"Is it a good idea to include a file that may contain passwords, such as 'config-production.php,' in Git?

I have two answers to this question:

- If the database is hosted on a public and easily accessible server, including a configuration file is out of the question. Indeed, by simply looking in the Git repository, all access information would be made available, seriously compromising the security of the application and the database.

- If the database is local (localhost: 127.0.0.1), this type of file doesn't pose much of a problem. Unless the machine hosting the application is attacked."
